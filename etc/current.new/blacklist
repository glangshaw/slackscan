# /etc/slackscan/current/blacklist
# Format: basic-regex
#
#  This file is the 'blacklist' file for the 'slackscan' utility.
#  Package files matching one of the following patterns will
#  be excluded from install and upgrade actions.
#
#  Caution!
#    Remember these are regexes. Watch out for partial matches
#    e.g.
#    '/pan' would blacklist both 'pan' and 'pango' which is likely
#    not what your intended. I would suggest sticking with patterns
#    like:
#    /xap/pan-
