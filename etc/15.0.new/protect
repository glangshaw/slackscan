# /etc/slackscan/15.0/protect
# Format: basic-regex
#
#  This file is the 'protect' file for the 'slackscan' utility.
#
#  This is essentially a blacklist specific to removal operations
#  and should be used to prevent the removal of packages whose
#  package file is no longer available in any configured location.
#
#  Important Note:
#    unlike the blacklist file which matches the full path of the package file,
#    this file matches only package names, so there is no path components or
#    \.t.z suffix to match.
#

## uncomment the following to protect any packages tagged _local:
# _local$

## uncomment the following to protect any packages tagged _SBo (slackbuilds.org):
# _SBo$
