#  This file is the 'filter' file for the 'slackscan' utility.
#  Package files not matching one of the following patterns will
#  be excluded from install and upgrade actions.
#
#  Patterns passed on the command line will be appended to those
#  in this file when processing the filters at run-time.
#
#  Patterns in the blacklist file are processed after these
#  filters are applied.

## The following example when uncommented would limit matches to
## packages found in slackware64-current and 'xv' from extra/
